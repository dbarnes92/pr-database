# SkillKeeper
TrueSkill-based player ratings bookkeeping application.

Current Todo list:
- [ ] Work with Smash.gg on fixing bugs
- [ ] Automatically remove DQ matches 
  - [ ] Smash.gg (easy to do, they have a status, they use the -1 rule)
  - [ ] Challonge (Probably will do some sort of -1 rule or something)
- [ ] Multiple worlds stored to one file? Requested by Dank
- [ ] When creating a new user, allow customizable fields for Sigma and mu or score/mu
  - [ ] "new season" option to reset the sigma for all players and keep mu's
    - This might also have a thing to average and distribute points based on previous rank
    - just a reminder: Score = mu - **k**\*sigma
  - [ ] requires a sigma/mu calculation to determine uncertainty
- [ ] Fix Move Match button enable/disable logic 
- [ ]
